# S-Token (Shield & Surplus)

### What it is <mark style="color:orange;">S-Token</mark>

S-Token is the “<mark style="color:orange;">**first-loss**</mark>” buffer that protects P and C.\
In return, it can earn a <mark style="color:orange;">**surplus yield**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">:</mark> a slice of **coupons**, a share of **protocol fees**, and a possible **points or airdrop** reward from issuer.

### Why it matters

* **Shield the system** – S absorbs first loss, stabilizing P and then C.
* **Multiple income sources** – Coupons + protocol fees + potential residuals (and, where applicable, issuer incentives/airdrops).
* **Risk-priced carry** – Higher expected yield for taking first-loss risk.

> Tip: **You sell protection and get paid for it.** If nothing bad happens, you keep the carry (coupon+fees+incentives) and the unused buffer. If losses occur, **you’re hit first**.

### Playing S with P / C (LEGO® combos)

* **P + S → “cash-plus”**: principal-heavy with a small yield kicker from S income; S amount kept modest to cap drawdown.
* **C + S → “enhanced carry”**: harvest coupons with fee share, while selling first-loss protection—higher carry, higher downside.
* **S only → “pure protection seller”**: maximum exposure to first-loss in exchange for the highest potential carry.

### Acquire & Exit

* **Acquire**
  * Wrap a supported RWA and **Split** into P/C/S.
  * **Buy** S-Token directly in the pool/AMM.
* **Exit**
  * **Sell anytime** at market price (T+0).
  * **At maturity**: if the bond repays in full, any **unused** S buffer + final fee/coupon shares are distributed to S holders. If losses occurred, your S position may be partially/fully reduced.

### FAQ

* **Is S-Token principal-protected?**\
  No. It’s **first-loss** by design. You are compensated via coupon share, fee share, and potential residual—**not** by a 1:1 redemption promise.
* **When do I earn?**\
  Throughout the term (coupon/fee distributions) and potentially at maturity (unused buffer), provided performance is on track.
* **What happens if there’s a default?**\
  S is reduced first. If the loss exceeds S, it then hits C, and only then P.
* **Can S-Token go to zero?**\
  Yes, in severe loss scenarios. Size positions accordingly.
* **Why do S-Tokens price so differently?**\
  Coverage %, asset quality, expected recoveries, time to maturity, and market liquidity all drive expected carry vs. expected loss.
